  abstract={A simple dynamical cascade model for the evolution of free energy is considered in the context of gyrokinetic formalism. It is noted that the dynamics of free energy, that characterize plasma micro-turbulence in magnetic fusion devices, exhibit a predator–prey character. Various key features of predator–prey dynamics such as the time delay between turbulence and large-scale flow structures, or the intermittency of the dynamics are identified in the quasi-steady-state phase of the nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. A novel prediction on the ratio of turbulence amplitudes in different parts of the wavenumber domain that follows from this simple predator–prey model is compared to a set of nonlinear simulation results and is observed to hold quite well in a large range of physical parameters. Detailed validation of the predator–prey hypothesis using nonlinear gyrokinetics provides a very important input for the effort to apprehend plasma micro-turbulence, since the predator–prey idea can be used as a very effective intuitive tool for understanding and designing efficient transport models.}

abstract = {Abstract In this study, we consider a mathematical model of two competing prey and one predator system where the prey species follow Lotka–Volterra-type dynamics and the predator uptake functions are ratio dependent. We have derived the conditions for existence of different boundary equilibria and discussed their global behaviour. The sufficient condition for permanent co-existence of all the species is derived. Finally, we have discussed the possibility of extinction of the species from the system. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}
